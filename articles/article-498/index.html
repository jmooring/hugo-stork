The cattle move about the field, the drift boulders slowly creep down the slopes; there is no doubt that the final source of the force is in both cases the same; what we call gravity, a name for a mystery, is the form it takes in the case of the rocks, and what we call vitality, another name for a mystery, is the form it takes in the case of the cattle; without the solar and stellar energy, could there be any motion of either rock or beast?"><title>Article 498 | Hugo + Stork</title><link rel=stylesheet href=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/basic.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/hugo-stork/assets/css/main.min.fe2c7c9b4abd453be8fe0fbf1984626dd74ac6b153bdd14dc14d92c2619cfab4.css integrity="sha256-/ix8m0q9RTvo/g+/GYRibddKxrFTvdFNwU2SwmGc+rQ="></head><body><header><a href=/hugo-stork/><div class=logo-container><img class="logo logo-hugo" src=/hugo-stork/images/hugo_hu70e954636c48aa334da307b6bc433ea6_64389_0x80_resize_q85_h2_box_3.webp alt="Hugo logo" width=305 height=80 title="The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites."><img class="logo logo-plus" src=/hugo-stork/images/plus_huc6702f23de1ef3864b89aabb6339fedd_1808_0x40_resize_q85_h2_box_3.webp alt="plus sign" width=40 height=40><img class="logo logo-stork" src=/hugo-stork/images/stork_hu7925e125c376b9172e0fdb1acea773c2_147052_0x80_resize_q85_h2_box.webp alt="Stork logo" width=80 height=80 title="Impossibly fast web search, made for static sites."></div></a><div class=stork-wrapper><input data-stork=site class=stork-input placeholder=Search><div data-stork=site-output class=stork-output></div></div></header><main><h1>Article 498</h1><p>We think of something in the organic that lifts and moves and redistributes dead matter, and builds it up into the ten thousand new forms which it would never assume without this something; it lifts lime and iron and silica and potash and carbon, against gravity, up into trees and animal forms, not by a new force, but by an old force in the hands of a new agent.</p><p>The cattle move about the field, the drift boulders slowly creep down the slopes; there is no doubt that the final source of the force is in both cases the same; what we call gravity, a name for a mystery, is the form it takes in the case of the rocks, and what we call vitality, another name for a mystery, is the form it takes in the case of the cattle; without the solar and stellar energy, could there be any motion of either rock or beast?</p><p>Force is universal, it pervades all nature, one manifestation of it we call heat, another light, another electricity, another cohesion, chemical affinity, and so on. May not another manifestation of it be called life, differing from all the rest more radically than they differ from one another; bound up with all the rest and inseparable from them and identical with them only in its ultimate source in the Creative Energy that is immanent in the universe? I have to think of the Creative Energy as immanent in all matter, and the final source of all the transformations and transmutations we see in the organic and the inorganic worlds. The very nature of our minds compels us to postulate some power, or some principle, not as lying back of, but as active in, all the changing forms of life and nature, and their final source and cause.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
