The body is a mechanism by virtue of its anatomy&ndash;its framework, its levers, its hinges; it is a mechanism by virtue of its chemical activities; and it is a mechanism by virtue of its colloid states&ndash;three kinds of mechanisms in one, and all acting together harmoniously and as a unit&ndash;in other words, a super-mechanical combination of activities.</p><p>The mechanical conception of life repels us because of its association in our minds with the fabrications of our own hands&ndash;the dead metal and wood and the noise and dust of our machine-ridden and machine-produced civilization.</p><p>But Nature makes no machines like our own. She uses mechanical principles everywhere, in inert matter and in living bodies, but she does not use them in the bald and literal way we do. We must divest her mechanisms of the rigidity and angularity that pertain to the works of our own hands. Her hooks and hinges and springs and sails and coils and aeroplanes, all involve mechanical contrivances, but how differently they impress us from our own application of the same principles! Even in inert matter&ndash;in the dews, the rains, the winds, the tides, the snows, the streams,&ndash;her mechanics and her chemistry and her hydrostatics and pneumatics, seem much nearer akin to life than our own. We must remember that Nature&rsquo;s machines are not human machines. When we place our machine so that it is driven by the great universal currents,&ndash;the wheel in the stream, the sail on the water,&ndash;the result is much more pleasing and poetic than when propelled by artificial power. The more machinery we get between ourselves and Nature, the farther off Nature seems. The marvels of crystallization, the beautiful vegetable forms which the frost etches upon the stone flagging of the sidewalk, and upon the window-pane, delight us and we do not reason why. A natural bridge pleases more than one which is the work of an engineer, yet the natural bridge can only stand when it is based upon good engineering principles. I found at the great Colorado Ca√±on, that the more the monuments of erosion were suggestive of human structures, or engineering and architectural works, the more I was impressed by them. We are pleased when Nature imitates man, and we are pleased when man imitates Nature, and yet we recoil from the thought that life is only applied mechanics and chemistry. But the thought that it is mechanics and chemistry applied by something of which they as such, form no part, some agent or principle which we call vitality, is welcome to us. No machine we have ever made or seen can wind itself up, or has life, no chemical compound from the laboratories ever develops a bit of organic matter, and therefore we are disbelievers in the powers of these things.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.2/stork.js></script>
