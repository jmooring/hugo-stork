What is new and beyond the reach of science to explain is the <em>kind of activity</em> of these elements. They enter into new compounds; they build up bodies that have new powers and properties; they people the seas and the air and the earth with living creatures, they build the body and brain of man. The secret of the activity in matter that we call vital is certainly beyond the power of science to tell us. It is like expecting that the paint and oil used in a great picture must differ from those in a daub. The great artist mixed his paint with brains, and the universal elements in a living body are mixed with something that science cannot disclose. Organic chemistry does not differ intrinsically from inorganic; the difference between the two lies in the purposive activity of the elements that build up a living body.</p><p>Or is life, as a New England college professor claims, &ldquo;an <em>x</em>-entity, additional to matter and energy, but of the same cosmic rank as they,&rdquo; and &ldquo;manifesting itself to our senses only through its power to keep a certain quantity of matter and energy in the continuous orderly ferment we call life&rdquo;?</p><p>I recall that Huxley said that there was a third reality in this universe besides matter and energy, and this third reality was consciousness. But neither the &ldquo;<em>x</em>-entity&rdquo; of Professor Ganong nor the &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; of Huxley can be said to be of the same cosmic rank as matter and energy, because they do not pervade the universe as matter and energy do. These forces abound throughout all space and endure throughout all time, but life and consciousness are flitting and uncertain phenomena of matter. A prick of a pin, or a blow from a hammer, may destroy both. Unless we consider them as potential in all matter (and who shall say that they are not?) may we look upon them as of cosmic rank?</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
