Snow and cold sometimes combine to do their worst.

Similar calamities used occasionally to afflict our primitive ancestors.</p><p>Over the vast Northwest a feature of the climate is the winter-annihilating Chinook wind. This occasionally saves the people of the wilds when other relief is impossible. The snowy earth is quickly transformed by this warm, dry wind. In a few hours conditions become summer-like. Fortunately, the Chinook often follows a blizzard. Many a time at the eleventh hour it has dramatically saved the waiting, suffering birds and rescued the snow-buried and starving folk of the wilds.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
