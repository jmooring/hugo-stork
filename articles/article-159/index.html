Large rewards were offered for his capture. Old trappers and hunters came from afar, but after weeks of trial gave up the pursuit.</p><p>The grizzly has a well-developed bump of curiosity. This sometimes betrays him into forgetfulness. On a few occasions I have come on one&ndash;and twice one unwittingly came close to me&ndash;while he was intent on solving something that had awakened that curiosity.</p><p>Once, while watching a forest fire, I climbed a mountain to a point above the tree-line in order to reach a safe and commanding spot from which to view the flames on a near-by slope. At the summit I came upon a grizzly within a few yards of me. He was squatting on his haunches like a dog, and was intently watching the fire-fount below. A deep roar at one place, high-leaping flames at another, a vast smoke-cloud at another,&ndash;each in turn caught his attention. None of his keen senses warned him of my presence, though I stood near him for two or three minutes. When I yelled at him he slowly turned his head and stared at me in a half-dazed manner. Then he angrily showed his teeth for a second or two, and finally&ndash;much to my relief&ndash;fled like a frightened rabbit.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
