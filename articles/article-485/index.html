Trail hurry frequently produces sickness. A brief dash may keep a climber agitated for an hour.

Early in the guiding game the solution was made impossible by trying to guide large parties and by not knowing human nature. Once accomplished, slow going on the trail noticeably decreased the cases of mountain-sickness, greatly reduced the number of quarrels, and enabled almost all starters to gain the height desired. Slow climbing added pleasure to the trip and enabled every one to return in good form and with splendid pictures in his mind.</p><p>To keep the party together,&ndash;for the tendency of climbers is to scatter, some traveling rapidly and others slowly,&ndash;it became my practice to stop occasionally and tell a story, comment on a bit of scenery, or relate an incident that had occurred near by. As I spoke in a low tone, the climbers ahead shouting &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; and the ones behind calling &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; could not hear me. This method kept down friction and usually held the party together. With a large party, however, confusion sometimes arose despite my efforts to anticipate it.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
