They begin with the earth&rsquo;s surface warm and moist, the atmosphere saturated with watery vapor and carbon dioxide and many other complex unstable compounds; then they summon all the material elements of life&ndash;carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with a little sodium, chlorine, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, and others&ndash;and make these run together to form a jelly-like body called a colloid; then they endow this jelly mass with the power of growth, and of subdivision when it gets too large; they make it able to absorb various unstable compounds from the air, giving it internal stores of energy, &ldquo;the setting free of which would cause automatic movements in the lump of jelly.&rdquo; Thus they lay the foundations of life. This carbonaceous material with properties of movement and subdivision due to mechanical and physical forces is the immediate ancestor of the first imaginary living being, the <em>protobion</em>. To get this <em>protobion</em> the chemists summon a reagent known as a catalyser. The catalyser works its magic on the jelly mass. It sets up a wonderful reaction by its mere presence, without parting with any of its substance. Thus, if a bit of platinum which has this catalytic power is dropped into a vessel containing a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, the two gases instantly unite and form water. A catalyser introduced in the primordial jelly liberates energy and gives the substance power to break up the various complex unstable compounds into food, and promote growth and subdivision. In fact, it awakens or imparts a vital force and leads to &ldquo;indefinite increase, subdivision, and movement.&rdquo;</p><p>With Professor Sch√§fer there is first &ldquo;the fortuitous production of life upon this globe&rdquo;&ndash;the chance meeting or jostling of the elements that resulted in a bit of living protoplasm, &ldquo;or a mass of colloid slime&rdquo; in the old seas, or on their shores, &ldquo;possessing the property of assimilation and therefore of growth.&rdquo; Here the whole mystery is swallowed at one gulp. &ldquo;Reproduction would follow as a matter of course,&rdquo; because all material of this physical nature&ndash;fluid or semi-fluid in character&ndash;&ldquo;has a tendency to undergo subdivision when its bulk exceeds a certain size.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A mass of colloidal slime&rdquo; that has the power of assimilation and of growth and reproduction, is certainly a new thing in the world, and no chemical analysis of it can clear up the mystery. It is easy enough to produce colloidal slime, but to endow it with these wonderful powers so that &ldquo;the promise and the potency of all terrestrial life&rdquo; slumbers in it is a staggering proposition.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
