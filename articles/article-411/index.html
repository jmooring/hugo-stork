If the evolutionary impulse fails on one line, it picks itself up and tries on another, it experiments endlessly like an inventor, but always improves on its last attempts. Chance would have kept things at a standstill; the principle of chance, give it time enough, must end where it began. Chance is a man lost in the woods; he never arrives; he wanders aimlessly. If evolution pursued a course equally fortuitous, would it not still be wandering in the wilderness of the chaotic nebulæ?</p><p>A vastly different and much more stimulating view of life is given by Henri Bergson in his &ldquo;Creative Evolution.&rdquo; Though based upon biological science, it is a philosophical rather than a scientific view, and appeals to our intuitional and imaginative nature more than to our constructive reason. M. Bergson interprets the phenomena of life in terms of spirit, rather than in terms of matter as does Professor Loeb. The word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; is the key-word to his view. Life is a creative impulse or current which arose in matter at a certain time and place, and flows through it from form to form, from generation to generation, augmenting in force as it advances. It is one with spirit, and is incessant creation; the whole organic world is filled, from bottom to top, with one tremendous effort. It was long ago felicitously stated by Whitman in his &ldquo;Leaves of Grass,&rdquo; &ldquo;Urge and urge, always the procreant urge of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>This conception of the nature and genesis of life is bound to be challenged by modern physical science, which, for the most part, sees in biology only a phase of physics; but the philosophic mind and the trained literary mind will find in &ldquo;Creative Evolution&rdquo; a treasure-house of inspiring ideas, and engaging forms of original artistic expression. As Mr. Balfour says, &ldquo;M. Bergson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Evolution Créatrice&rsquo; is not merely a philosophical treatise, it has all the charm and all the audacities of a work of art, and as such defies adequate reproduction.&rdquo;</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
