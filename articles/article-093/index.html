It is biotic energy which guides the development of the ovum, which regulates the exchanges of the cell, and causes such phenomena as nerve impulse, muscular contraction, and gland secretion, and it is a form of energy which arises in colloidal structures, just as magnetism appears in iron, or radio-activity in uranium or radium, and in its manifestations it undergoes exchanges with other forms of energy, in the same manner as these do among one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Like Professor Henderson, Professor Moore concedes to the vitalists about all they claim&ndash;namely, that there is some form of force or manifestation of energy peculiar to living bodies, and one that cannot be adequately described in terms of physics and chemistry. Professor Moore says this biotic energy &ldquo;arises in colloidal structures,&rdquo; and so far as biochemistry can make out, arises <em>spontaneously</em> and gives rise to that marvelous bit of mechanism, the cell. In the cell appears &ldquo;a form of energy unknown outside life processes which leads the mazy dance of life from point to point, each new development furnishing a starting point for the next one.&rdquo; It not only leads the dance along our own line of descent from our remote ancestors&ndash;it leads the dance along the long road of evolution from the first unicellular form in the dim pal√¶ozoic seas to the complex and highly specialized forms of our own day.</p><p>The secret of this life force, or biotic energy, according to Professor Moore, is in the keeping of matter itself. The steps or stages from the depths of matter by which life arose, lead up from that imaginary something, the electron, to the inorganic colloids, or to the crystallo-colloids, which are the threshold of life, each stage showing some new transformation of energy. There must be an all-potent energy transformation before we can get chemical energy out of physical energy, and then biotic energy out of chemical energy. This transformation of inorganic energy into life energy cannot be traced or repeated in the laboratory, yet science believes the secret will sometime be in its hands. It is here that the materialistic philosophers, such as Professors Moore and Loeb, differ from the spiritualistic philosophers, such as Bergson, Sir Oliver Lodge, Professor Thompson, and others.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.2/stork.js></script>
