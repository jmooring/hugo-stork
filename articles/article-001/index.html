The mechanical, the automatic, is the antithesis of the spontaneous and the poetic, and it repels us on that account. We are so made that the artificial systems please us far less than the natural systems. A sailing-ship takes us more than a steamship. It is nearer life, nearer the winged creatures. There is determinism in nature, mechanical forces are everywhere operative, but there are no machines in the proper sense of the word. When we call an organism a living machine we at once take it out of the categories of the merely mechanical and automatic and lift it into a higher order&ndash;the vital order.</p><p>Professor Le Dantec says we are mechanisms in the third degree, a mechanism of a mechanism of a mechanism. The body is a mechanism by virtue of its anatomy&ndash;its framework, its levers, its hinges; it is a mechanism by virtue of its chemical activities; and it is a mechanism by virtue of its colloid states&ndash;three kinds of mechanisms in one, and all acting together harmoniously and as a unit&ndash;in other words, a super-mechanical combination of activities.</p><p>The mechanical conception of life repels us because of its association in our minds with the fabrications of our own hands&ndash;the dead metal and wood and the noise and dust of our machine-ridden and machine-produced civilization.</p><p><em>Last modified: November 26, 2022</em></p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.2/stork.js></script>
