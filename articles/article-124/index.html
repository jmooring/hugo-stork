The sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species, seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species, when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed. This view is supported by a parallelism of another kind;&ndash;namely, that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings. It is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of their hybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to distinct causes; for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced from it, and the capacity of being grafted together&ndash;though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances&ndash;should all run, to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species.</p><p>First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very generally, but not quiteuniversally, fertile. Nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and not of differences in the reproductive system. In all other respects, excluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.</p><p>On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day&ndash;On the nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number&ndash;On the vast lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation&ndash;On the poorness of our palæontological collections&ndash;On the intermittence of geological formations&ndash;On the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation&ndash;On the sudden appearance of groups of species&ndash;On their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
