Bergson, life is the flowing metamorphosis of the poets,&ndash;an unceasing becoming,&ndash;and evolution is a wave of creative energy overflowing through matter &ldquo;upon which each visible organism rides during the short interval of time given it to live.&rdquo; In his view, matter is held in the iron grip of necessity, but life is freedom itself. &ldquo;Before the evolution of life &mldr; the portals of the future remain wide open. It is a creation that goes on forever in virtue of an initial movement. This movement constitutes the unity of the organized world&ndash;a prolific unity, of an infinite richness, superior to any that the intellect could dream of, for the intellect is only one of its aspects or products.&rdquo;</p><p>What a contrast to Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s view of life and evolution! &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; says Spencer, &ldquo;consists of inner action so adjusted as to balance outer action.&rdquo; True enough, no doubt, but not interesting. If the philosopher could tell us what it is that brings about the adjustment, and that profits by it, we should at once prick up our ears. Of course, it is life. But what is life? It is inner action so adjusted as to balance outer action!</p><p>A recent contemptuous critic of M. Bergson&rsquo;s book, Hugh S. R. Elliot, points out, as if he were triumphantly vindicating the physico-chemical theory of the nature and origin of life, what a complete machine a cabbage is for converting solar energy into chemical and vital energy&ndash;how it takes up the raw material from the soil by a chemical and mechanical process, how these are brought into contact with the light and air through the leaves, and thus the cabbage is built up. In like manner, a man is a machine for converting chemical energy derived from the food he eats into motion, and the like. As if M. Bergson, or any one else, would dispute these things! In the same way, a steam-engine is a machine for converting the energy latent in coal into motion and power; but what force lies back of the engine, and was active in the construction?</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
