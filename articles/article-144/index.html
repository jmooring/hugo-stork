This basin is almost encircled by eight towering peaks, and the enormous St. Vrain Moraine thrusts out of its outlet and shows where the united ice-rivers formerly made their way from this basin. Within this wild area are lakes, forests, waterfalls, and a splendid variety of wild and lovely scenes.</p><p>The glacier lakes and wild tarns of this Park are one of its delights. Though most of these water fountains are small, they are singularly beautiful. They are in the middle-mountain zone, in a belt which lies between the altitudes of ten thousand and twelve thousand feet. There are more than a hundred of these, and their attractiveness equals that of any of the mountain lakes of the world.</p><p>The best known and most popular of these lakes are Fern and Odessa. These lie about twelve miles west of the village of Estes Park. Chasm Lake, on the east side of Long&rsquo;s Peak, is set in an utterly wild place. Its basin was gouged from solid granite by the old Long&rsquo;s Peak Glacier. Mt. Washington, Mt. Meeker, and Long&rsquo;s Peak tower above it, and around it these peaks have flung their wreckage in chaotic confusion. A glacier almost crawls into it, and the east precipice of Long&rsquo;s Peak, the greatest precipice in the Park, looms above it.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
