Each of these serves in a distinct way, and it is of utmost importance that each be in charge of its specialist. The forester is always the lumberman, the park man is a practical poet; the forester thinks ever of lumber, the park man always of landscapes. The forester must cut trees before they are over-ripe or his crop will waste, while the park man wants the groves to become aged and picturesque. The forester pastures cattle in his meadows, while the park man has only people and romping children among his wild flowers. The park needs the charm of primeval nature, and should be free from ugliness, artificiality, and commercialism. For the perpetuation of scenery, a landscape artist is absolutely necessary. It would be folly to put a park man in charge of a forest reserve, a lumbering proposition. On the other hand, what a blunder to put a tree-cutting forester in charge of a park! We need both these men; each is important in his place; but it would be a double misfortune to put one in charge of the work of the other. A National Park service is greatly needed.</p><p>Apparently William Penn was the first to honor our scenery, and Bryant, with poetry, won a literary standing for it. Official recognition came later, but the establishment of the Yellowstone National Park was a great incident in the scenic history of America&ndash;and in that of the world. For the first time, a scenic wonderland was dedicated as &ldquo;a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of all the people.&rdquo; The Yellowstone stands a high tribute to the statesmanship, the public spirit, and the energy of F. V. Hayden and the few men who won it for us.</p><p>During the last few years the nation, as well as the courts, has put itself on record concerning the higher worth of scenery. The White House conference of governors recommended that &ldquo;the beauty &mldr; of our country should be preserved and increased&rdquo;; and the first National Conservation Commission thought that &ldquo;public lands more valuable for conserving &mldr; natural beauties and wonders than for agriculture should be held for the use of the people.&rdquo;</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
