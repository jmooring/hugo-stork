Cheyenne Cañon is more imposing by being alone,&ndash;away from other cañons. This cañon opens upon the plains. It is a cañon that would win attention anywhere, but its situation is a most favorable one. Low altitude and a warm climate welcome trees, grass, bushes, and many kinds of plants and flowers. These cling to every break, spot, ledge, terrace, and niche, and thereby touch and decorate the cañon&rsquo;s grim and towering walls with lovely beauty. Walls, water, and verdure&ndash;water in pools and falls, rocks in cliffs, terraces, and domes, grass and flowers on slopes and terraces, trees and groves,&ndash;a magnificence of rocks, a richness of verdure, and the charm of running water&ndash;all unite in a picturesque association which makes a glorious and pleasing sunken garden.</p><p>It is probable that Pike&rsquo;s Peak was discovered by Spanish explorers either in 1598 or in 1601. These are the dates of separate exploring expeditions which entered Colorado from the south and marched up the plains in near view of this peak. The discovery is usually accredited, however, to Lieutenant Pike, who caught sight of it on the 15th day of November, 1806. Pike&rsquo;s journal of this date says: &ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon I thought I could distinguish a mountain to our right which appeared like a small blue cloud; viewed it with a spyglass and was still more confirmed in my conjecture&mldr;. In half an hour it appeared in full view before us. When our small party arrived on a hill, they with one accord gave three cheers to the Mexican Mountains.&rdquo; It appears not to have been called Pike&rsquo;s Peak until about twenty-five years after Pike first saw it. He spoke of it as the Mexican Mountains and as Great Peak. The first ascent by white men was made July 14, 1819, by members of Lieutenant Long&rsquo;s exploring expedition. For a number of years this peak was called James Peak, in honor of the naturalist in the Long exploring party.</p><p>Pike&rsquo;s Peak has what Montesquieu calls the &ldquo;most powerful of all empires, the empire of climate.&rdquo; It stands most of the time in the sun. All over it the miner and the prospector have searched for gold, mutilating it here and there with holes. Fires have scarred the sides, and pasturing has robbed it of flowers and verdure. The reputed discovery of gold at its base started a flood of gold-seekers west with &ldquo;Pike&rsquo;s Peak or bust&rdquo; enthusiasm. But the climate and scenery of this peak attract people who come for pleasure and to seek for health. It has thus brought millions of dollars into Colorado, and it will probably continue to attract people who seek pleasure and refreshment and who receive in exchange higher values than they spend. Pike&rsquo;s Peak is a rich asset.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
