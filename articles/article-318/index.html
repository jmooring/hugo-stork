With kind treatment and experience the horses learn to meet emergencies without hesitation.

If killed or stolen, as sometimes happens, the owner is the loser. However, there is another unwritten law which places the catching or riding of these horses in the category of horse-stealing,&ndash;a serious matter in the West.</p><p>I rode Cricket from Silverton to Ouray, and on the way we became intimately acquainted.
