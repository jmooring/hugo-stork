Bergson and Sir Oliver Lodge do, existing apart from the matter it animates.</p><p>Sir Oliver Lodge, famous physicist that he is, yet has a vein of mysticism and idealism in him which sometimes makes him recoil from the hard-and-fast interpretations of natural phenomena by physical science. Like M. Bergson, he sees in life some tendency or impetus which arose in matter at a definite time and place, &ldquo;and which has continued to interact with and incarnate itself in matter ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>If a living body is a machine, then we behold a new kind of machine with new kinds of mechanical principles&ndash;a machine that repairs itself, that reproduces itself, a clock that winds itself up, an engine that stokes itself, a gun that aims itself, a machine that divides and makes two, two unite and make four, a million or more unite and make a man or a tree&ndash;a machine that is nine tenths water, a machine that feeds on other machines, a machine that grows stronger with use; in fact, a machine that does all sorts of unmechanical things and that no known combination of mechanical and chemical principles can reproduce&ndash;a vital machine. The idea of the vital as something different from and opposed to the mechanical must come in. Something had to be added to the mechanical and chemical to make the vital.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
