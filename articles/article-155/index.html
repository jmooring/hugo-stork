To me it was most captivating in a little mountain meadow. Even in a circle of friends it may shut out all else, and with it one may return through &ldquo;yesterday&rsquo;s seven thousand years.&rdquo; But to be completely under its spell one must be alone with its changing flame. Although I have watched the camp-fire all alone in many scenes,&ndash;in the wilderness, at the shore of the sea, at timber-line, and on the desert in the shadow of the prehistoric cactus,&ndash;nowhere has my imagination been more deeply stirred than it was one night by my camp-fire in a little mountain meadow. Around were the silent ranks of trees. Here the world was new and the fire blazed in primeval scenes. Its strange dance of lights and shadows against the trees rebuilt for me the past. Once more I felt the hopes and dreads of savage life. Once more I knew the legends that were told when the first camp-fire burned.</p><p>Not until one year of drought did I realize how dependent the beaver is upon a constant water-supply that is both fresh and ample. A number of beaver colonies close to my cabin were badly afflicted by this dry period. I was already making special studies of beaver ways among the forty-odd beaver colonies that were within a few miles of my mountain home, and toward the close of this droughty summer I made frequent rounds among the beaver. By the middle of September I confined these attentions to five of the colonies that were most affected by low water. Two were close to each other, but upon separate brooks. The other three were upon one tumbling streamlet.</p><p>Autumn is the busiest time of the year in beaver world. Harvest is then gathered, the dam is repaired, sometimes the pond is partly dredged, and the house is made ready for winter,&ndash;all before the pond freezes over. But drought had so afflicted these colonies that in only one had any of the harvest been gathered. This one I called the Cascade Colony. It was the uppermost of the three that were dependent upon this one stream. Among the five colonies that I observed that autumn, this one had the most desperate and tragic experience.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
