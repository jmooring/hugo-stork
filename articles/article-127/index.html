But to combine them in the laboratory so as to produce the compounds out of which the body can extract force is impossible. We can make an unstable compound that will hurl a ton of iron ten miles, but not one that when exploded in the digestive tract of the human body will lift a hair.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
