We can send an electric spark through a room full of oxygen and hydrogen gas, and with a tremendous explosion we have water&ndash;an element of life, but not life.</p><p>Some of the elements seem nearer life than others. Water is near life; heat, light, the colloid state are near life; osmosis, oxidation, chemical reactions are near life; the ashes of inorganic bodies are nearer life than the same minerals in the rocks and soil; but none of these things is life.</p><p>The chemical mixture of some of the elements gives us our high explosives&ndash;gunpowder, guncotton, and the like; their organic mixture gives a slower kind of explosive&ndash;bread, meat, milk, fruit, which, when acted upon by the vital forces of the body, yield the force that is the equivalent of the work the body does. But to combine them in the laboratory so as to produce the compounds out of which the body can extract force is impossible. We can make an unstable compound that will hurl a ton of iron ten miles, but not one that when exploded in the digestive tract of the human body will lift a hair.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
