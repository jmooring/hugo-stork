Individual observations and the special investigations of scientific men show that altitude has been a large, unconscious source of nature-faking. During the summer of 1911 a number of English and American scientists, the &ldquo;Anglo-American Expedition,&rdquo; spent five weeks on Pike&rsquo;s Peak, making special studies of the effects of altitude. Their investigations explode the theory that altitude is a strain upon the heart, or injurious to the system. These men concluded that the heart is subjected to no greater strain in high altitudes than at sea-level, except under the strain of physical exertion. The blood is richer in high altitudes. For every hundred red corpuscles found at sea-level there are in Colorado Springs, at six thousand feet, one hundred and ten; and on the summit of Pike&rsquo;s Peak, from one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty-four.</p><p>&ldquo;The danger to people suffering from heart trouble coming into high altitudes is grossly exaggerated,&rdquo; says Dr. Edward C. Schneider, one of the Anglo-American expedition. &ldquo;The rate of circulation is not materially increased. The blood-pressure on the Peak is not increased; it is even lowered. The heart&ndash;if a person exercises&ndash;may beat a little faster but it does not pump any more blood. The pulse is a little more rapid. If a man suffering from heart trouble rode up the peak on a train, remained in his seat, and did not exert himself physically, his heart would not beat a bit faster at the summit than when he left Manitou. But if he walked about on the summit there would be a change, for the exercise would make the heart work harder.&rdquo; But exercise is not injurious; it is beneficial.</p><p>As I found in guiding on Long&rsquo;s Peak, the rarefied air of the heights was often stimulating, especially to the tongue. Rarefied air is likened by the scientists to &ldquo;laughing-gas&rdquo; and furnishes a plausible explanation of the queerness which characterizes the action of many people on mountain-summits. &ldquo;We saw many visitors at the summit,&rdquo; said Dr. Schneider in explaining this phase, &ldquo;who appeared to be intoxicated. But there was no smell of liquor on their breath. They were intoxicated with rarefied atmosphere, not with alcohol. The peculiar effects of laughing-gas and carbon-monoxide gas on people are due to the lack of oxygen in the gas; and the same applies to the air at high altitudes.&rdquo;</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
