We can only look upon a living body as a machine by forming new conceptions of a machine&ndash;a machine utterly unmechanical, which is a contradiction of terms.</p><p>A man may expend the same kind of force in thinking that he expends in chopping his wood, but that fact does not put the two kinds of activity on the same level. There is no question but that the food consumed is the source of the energy in both cases, but in the one the energy is muscular, and in the other it is nervous. When we speak of mental or spiritual force, we have as distinct a conception as when we speak of physical force. It requires physical force to produce the effect that we call mental force, though how the one can result in the other is past understanding. The law of the correlation and conservation of energy requires that what goes into the body as physical force must come out in some form of physical force&ndash;heat, light, electricity, and so forth.</p></main><script src=https://files.stork-search.net/releases/v1.4.1/stork.js></script>
