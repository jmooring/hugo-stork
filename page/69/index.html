Living matter is characterized by &ldquo;spontaneity of action,&rdquo; which is entirely absent from inert matter.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-341/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-342/>Article 342</a></h2>We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. Many of them are very serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-342/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-343/>Article 343</a></h2>Though weirdly interesting, these ashen fields of desolation were not wholly lifeless. Here, as elsewhere, feasters came to banquet, and good fortune brought favorites to the scene of panic and death. Flocks of gorged magpies were about, and unwontedly bold coyotes, both filled and foraging, were frequently met with. At one place a half-dozen beaver were portaging round a tumble of charred tree-trunks that obstructed the brook-channel. Fire had destroyed the food-supply, and the beaver were seeking home and harvest in other scenes.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-343/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-344/>Article 344</a></h2>How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,&ndash;namely the very general, but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adult;&ndash;of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early period of growth alike;&ndash;of embryos of different species within the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;&ndash;of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itself;&ndash;of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed?
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-344/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-345/>Article 345</a></h2>This is an extremely intricate subject. A large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable, but I believe mere individual differences suffice for the work. A large number of individuals, by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely important element of success. Though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.
