You are sure to be lost in wonder and praise, and every hair of your head will stand up and hum and sing like an enthusiastic congregation.
After this reviving experience, you should take a look into a few of the tertiary volumes of the grand geological library of the park, and see how God writes history.

It forms the extreme edge of the timber-line on both flanks of the summit mountains—if so lowly a tree can be called timber—at an elevation of ten to twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea.

Grazing, lumbering, shooting, and other commercial, conflicting, and disfiguring uses should be rigidly prohibited. Scenery, like beauty, has superior merit, and its supreme use is by people for rest and recreation purposes.
Switzerland after long experience is establishing National Parks and giving these a separate and distinct management from her forest reserves.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-054/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-055/>Article 055</a></h2>The new school of biologists start with matter that possesses extraordinary properties&ndash;with matter that seems inspired with the desire for life, and behaving in a way that it never will behave in the laboratory. They begin with the earth&rsquo;s surface warm and moist, the atmosphere saturated with watery vapor and carbon dioxide and many other complex unstable compounds; then they summon all the material elements of life&ndash;carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with a little sodium, chlorine, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, and others&ndash;and make these run together to form a jelly-like body called a colloid; then they endow this jelly mass with the power of growth, and of subdivision when it gets too large; they make it able to absorb various unstable compounds from the air, giving it internal stores of energy, &ldquo;the setting free of which would cause automatic movements in the lump of jelly.
