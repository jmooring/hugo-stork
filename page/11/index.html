The site contains 500 articles with an average of 520 words per article.</p><p>One of the configuration options for Stork is <code>save_nearest_html_id</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If <code>true</code>, correlates each word in an HTML document with the nearest ID in the document. The Stork web interface will link directly to that ID, helping your users jump directly to the content they search for.</p></blockquote><p>Test by searching this site for &ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; (case-insensitive). It will bring you to Article 042, targeting the heading nearest to the word.</p><hr><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-031/>Article 031</a></h2>Every species of animal has something about it that is unique and individual and that no chemical or physiological analysis of it will show&ndash;probably some mode of motion among its ultimate particles that is peculiar to itself. This prevents cross-breeding among different species and avoids a chaos of animal and vegetable forms. Living tissues and living organs from one species cannot be grafted upon the individuals of another species; the kidney of a cat, for instance, cannot be substituted for that of a dog, although the functions and the anatomy of the two are identical.

They may journey down-stream or across lakes on a log, fly with birds across mountain-ranges, ride by easy stages clinging to the fur of animals, or be blown in storms across deserts; but these adventurous seeds may find grass in possession of the locality and so thickly sodded that for a century or longer they may try in vain to establish a forest.

They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. Yet I fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors.
