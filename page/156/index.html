If such gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species.

Thus the German physiologist Verworn, the determined enemy of the old conception of life, in his great work on &ldquo;Irritability,&rdquo; has recourse to &ldquo;the specific energy of living substances.&rdquo; One is forced to believe that without this &ldquo;specific energy&rdquo; his &ldquo;living substances&rdquo; would never have arisen out of the non-living.

At timber-line snow may fall any day of the year, and wintry conditions annually prevail from nine to ten months. The hardy trees which maintain this line have adjusted themselves to the extremely short growing-season, and now and then mature and scatter fertile seeds. The trees that do heroic service on all latitudinal and altitudinal timber-lines of the earth are members of the pine, spruce, fir, birch, willow, and aspen families.
