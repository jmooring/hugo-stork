In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and useless. In workson natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created &ldquo;for the sake of symmetry,&rdquo; or in order &ldquo;to complete the scheme of nature;&rdquo; but this seems to me no explanation, merely a re-statement of the fact.

Charcoal has been found in fossil. This has a possible age of a million years. Charred logs have been found, in Dakota and elsewhere, several hundred feet beneath the surface. The big trees of California have fire scars that are two thousand years old.
The most remarkable forest fire records that I ever saw were found in a giant California redwood. This tree was felled a few years ago.

From this point magnificent scenes spread away on every hand. Here we lingered to enjoy the view and to watch the antics of the return ponies. Two of them, just released, were rolling vigorously, despite their saddles. This rolling enabled me to understand the importance of every liveryman&rsquo;s caution to strangers, &ldquo;Be sure to tighten the saddle-cinches before you let the pony go.

Most of the broad summit is comparatively level and smooth, and covered with crystals of quartz, mica, hornblende, feldspar, garnet, zircon, tourmaline, etc.

In summer they extend smooth, even, undulating, continuous beds of flowers and leaves from about lat. 62Â° to the shores of the Arctic Ocean; and in winter sheets of snowflowers make all the country shine, one mass of white radiance like a star. Nor are these Arctic plant people the pitiful frost-pinched unfortunates they are guessed to be by those who have never seen them.
