The Stork web interface will link directly to that ID, helping your users jump directly to the content they search for.</p></blockquote><p>Test by searching this site for &ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; (case-insensitive). It will bring you to Article 042, targeting the heading nearest to the word.</p><hr><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-388/>Article 388</a></h2>We may follow life down to the ground, yes, under the ground, into the very roots of matter and motion, yea, beyond the roots, into the imaginary world of molecules and atoms, and their attractions and repulsions and not find its secret. Indeed, science&ndash;the new science&ndash;pursues matter to the vanishing-point, where it ceases to become matter and becomes pure force or spirit. What takes place in that imaginary world where ponderable matter ends and becomes disembodied force, and where the hypothetical atoms are no longer divisible, we may conjecture but may never know.

In about half an hour he knocked five large salmon out of the water. With a single stroke of his fore paw each fish was flung on the shore, fifteen or twenty feet away. He made only one miss. These salmon weighed between five and twenty pounds each.
