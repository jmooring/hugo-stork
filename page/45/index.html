Lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-133/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-134/>Article 134</a></h2>I have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to render it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. But further than this, variations which, for all that we can see, might have appeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-134/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-135/>Article 135</a></h2>In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other remarks. I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted.
