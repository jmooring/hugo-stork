By the time lodge-poles are sixty years of age their self-thinning has made openings in their crowded ranks. In these openings the shade-enduring seedlings of other species make a start. Years go by, and these seedlings become great trees that overtop the circle of lodge-poles around them.

The view is distasteful to a certain type of mind&ndash;the flexible, imaginative, artistic, and literary type&ndash;the type that loves to see itself reflected in nature or that reads its own thoughts and emotions into nature.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-017/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-018/>Article 018</a></h2>Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other.
