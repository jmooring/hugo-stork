I may recall the well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals, for its thickness, belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series.

What is new and beyond the reach of science to explain is the kind of activity of these elements. They enter into new compounds; they build up bodies that have new powers and properties; they people the seas and the air and the earth with living creatures, they build the body and brain of man.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-038/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-039/>Article 039</a></h2>Evidently the cells in the body do not all have the same degree of life,&ndash;that is, the same degree of irritability. The bone cells and the hair cells, for instance, can hardly be so much alive&ndash;or so irritable&ndash;as the muscle cells; nor these as intensely alive as the nerve and brain cells. Does not a bird possess a higher degree of life than a mollusk, or a turtle? Is not a brook trout more alive than a mud-sucker?
