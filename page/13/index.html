Strolling forward, wondering who could have built it, I found an old, weary-eyed, speculative, gray-haired man on a bark stool by the door, reading a book.

<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-062/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-063/>Article 063</a></h2>Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms. I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at least in regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times.

A noted European chemist, Dr. Leduc, has produced what he calls &ldquo;osmotic growths,&rdquo; from purely unorganized mineral matter&ndash;growths in form like seaweed and polyps and corals and trees. His seeds are fragments of calcium chloride, and his soil is a solution of the alkaline carbonates, phosphates, or silicates. When his seeds are sown in these solutions, we see inert matter germinating, &ldquo;putting forth bud and stem and root and branch and leaf and fruit,&rdquo; precisely as in the living vegetable kingdom.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-064/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-065/>Article 065</a></h2>One calm morning at sunrise I saw the oaks and pines in Yosemite Valley shaken by an earthquake, their tops swishing back and forth, and every branch and needle shuddering as if in distress like the frightened screaming birds. One may imagine the trembling, rocking, tumultuous waving of those ancient Yellowstone woods, and the terror of their inhabitants when the first foreboding shocks were felt, the sky grew dark, and rock-laden floods began to roar.
