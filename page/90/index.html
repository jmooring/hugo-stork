Well mounted, we pushed rapidly upon the South Fork of the river and soon after noon were among the giants once more. On the divide between the Tule and Deer Creek a central camp was made, and the mountaineer spent his time in deer-hunting, while with provisions for two or three days I explored the woods, and in accordance with what I had been told soon reached the southern extremity of the belt on the South Fork of Deer Creek.

Bergson, life is the flowing metamorphosis of the poets,&ndash;an unceasing becoming,&ndash;and evolution is a wave of creative energy overflowing through matter &ldquo;upon which each visible organism rides during the short interval of time given it to live.&rdquo; In his view, matter is held in the iron grip of necessity, but life is freedom itself. &ldquo;Before the evolution of life &mldr; the portals of the future remain wide open. It is a creation that goes on forever in virtue of an initial movement.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-447/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-448/>Article 448</a></h2>The evolution of life is, of course, bound up with the evolution of the world. As the globe has ripened and matured, life has matured; higher and higher forms&ndash;forms with larger and larger brains and more and more complex nerve mechanisms&ndash;have appeared.
Physicists teach us that the evolution of the primary elements&ndash;hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, calcium, and the like&ndash;takes place in a solar body as the body cools. As temperature decreases, one after another of the chemical elements makes its appearance, the simpler elements appearing first, and the more complex compounds appearing last, all apparently having their origin in some simple parent element.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-448/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-449/>Article 449</a></h2>So there we are, confronted by two apparently contrary truths. It is to me unthinkable that the vital order is not as truly rooted in the constitution of things as are the mechanical and chemical orders; and yet, here we are face to face with its limited, fugitive, or transitional character. It comes and goes like the dews of the morning; it has all the features of an exceptional, unexpected, extraordinary occurrence&ndash;of miracle, if you will; but if the light which physical science turns on the universe is not a delusion, if the habit of mind which it begets is not a false one, then life belongs to the same category of things as do day and night, rain and sun, rest and motion.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-449/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-450/>Article 450</a></h2>It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern forms.
