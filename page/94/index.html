If such gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species.

Thus the German physiologist Verworn, the determined enemy of the old conception of life, in his great work on &ldquo;Irritability,&rdquo; has recourse to &ldquo;the specific energy of living substances.&rdquo; One is forced to believe that without this &ldquo;specific energy&rdquo; his &ldquo;living substances&rdquo; would never have arisen out of the non-living.

At timber-line snow may fall any day of the year, and wintry conditions annually prevail from nine to ten months. The hardy trees which maintain this line have adjusted themselves to the extremely short growing-season, and now and then mature and scatter fertile seeds. The trees that do heroic service on all latitudinal and altitudinal timber-lines of the earth are members of the pine, spruce, fir, birch, willow, and aspen families.

Often they come into my cabin for food or for paper to use for bedding. Occasionally one will sit erect upon my knee or shoulder, sometimes looking off intently into the yard; at other times apparently seeing nothing, but wrapped in meditation. More often, however, they are storing peanuts in their pouches or deliberately eating a kernel.

But it is something in them that never went into them; it arose in them. It is the living eye and the living brain that do the seeing and the thinking. When the life activity ceases, these organs cease to see and to think. Their activity is kept up by certain physiological processes in the organs of the body, and to ask what keeps up these is like the puppy trying to overtake its own tail, or to run a race with its own shadow.
