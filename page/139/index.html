Professor Rand thinks that in a mechanically determined universe, &ldquo;our conscious life becomes a meaningless replica of an inexorable physical concatenation&rdquo;&ndash;the soul the result of a fortuitous concourse of atoms. Hence all the science and art and literature and religion of the world are merely the result of a molecular accident.
Dr. Rand himself, in wrestling with the problem of organization in a late number of &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; seems to hesitate whether or not to regard man as a molecular accident, an appearance presented to us by the results of the curious accidents of molecules&ndash;which is essentially Professor Loeb&rsquo;s view; or whether to look upon the living body as the result of a &ldquo;specific something&rdquo; that organizes, that is, of &ldquo;dominating organic agencies,&rdquo; be they psychic or super-mundane, which dominate and determine the organization of the different parts of the body into a whole.

At the age of two thousand and eighty-eight years the fourth fire attacked it. This fire burned an eighteen-foot scar upon the trunk of the old tree. In 1900, after the lapse of almost a century, only a small part of this wound was overgrown. This year, 1900, came the reaper, the axeman, who laid low this aged and monumental tree!
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-416/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-417/>Article 417</a></h2>It is reported that a French scientist has discovered the secret of the glow-worm&rsquo;s light. Of course it is a chemical reaction,&ndash;what else could it be?&ndash;but it is a chemical reaction in a vital process. Our mental and spiritual life&ndash;our emotions of art, poetry, religion&ndash;are inseparable from physical processes in the brain and the nervous system; but is that their final explanation? The sunlight has little effect on a withered leaf, but see what effect it has upon the green leaf upon the tree!
