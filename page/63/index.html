With M. Bergson, life is the flowing metamorphosis of the poets,&ndash;an unceasing becoming,&ndash;and evolution is a wave of creative energy overflowing through matter &ldquo;upon which each visible organism rides during the short interval of time given it to live.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-311/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-312/>Article 312</a></h2>The cast-iron conclusions of physical science do pinch the Harvard professor a bit, and he pads them with a little of the Bergsonian philosophy. Bergson himself is not pinched at all by the conclusions of positive science. He sees that we, as human beings, cannot live in this universe without supplementing our science with some sort of philosophy that will help us to escape from the fatalism of matter and force into the freedom of the spiritual life.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-312/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-313/>Article 313</a></h2>All living bodies, when life leaves them, go back to the earth from whence they came. What was it in the first instance that gathered their elements from the earth and built them up into such wonderful mechanisms? If we say it was nature, do we mean by nature a physical force or an immaterial principle? Did the earth itself bring forth a man, or did something breathe upon the inert clay till it became a living spirit?
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-313/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-314/>Article 314</a></h2>When, like a merchant taking a list of his goods, we take stock of our wildness, we are glad to see how much of even the most destructible kind is still unspoiled. Looking at our continent as scenery when it was all wild, lying between beautiful seas, the starry sky above it, the starry rocks beneath it, to compare its sides, the East and the West, would be like comparing the sides of a rainbow.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-314/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-315/>Article 315</a></h2>Perhaps more than half of all the Big Trees have been sold, and are now in the hands of speculators and mill men. Even the beautiful little Calaveras Grove of ninety trees, so historically interesting from its being the first discovered, is now owned, together with the much larger South or Stanislaus Grove, by a lumber company.
Far the largest and most important section of protected Big Trees is in the grand Sequoia National Park, now easily accessible by stage from Visalia.
