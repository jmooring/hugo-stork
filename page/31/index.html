<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-151/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-152/>Article 152</a></h2>We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would seriously affect many of the others.

These are the tools of the creative process, but they are not that process, nor its prime cause. Start the flame of life going, and the rest may be explained in terms of chemistry; start the human body developing, and physiological processes explain its growth; but why it becomes a man and not a monkey&ndash;what explains that?
If one attempts to reach any rational conclusion on the question of the nature and origin of life on this planet, he soon finds himself in close quarters with two difficulties.

The greatest height at which I have observed them was about twelve thousand feet, over the summits of Mount Hoffman, in the middle region of the Park. A few pairs had their nests on the cliffs of this mountain, and could be seen every day in summer, hunting marmots, mountain beavers, pikas, etc. A pair of golden eagles have made their home in Yosemite ever since I went there thirty years ago.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-154/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-155/>Article 155</a></h2>A camp-fire anywhere in the wilderness appeals strongly to the imagination. To me it was most captivating in a little mountain meadow. Even in a circle of friends it may shut out all else, and with it one may return through &ldquo;yesterday&rsquo;s seven thousand years.&rdquo; But to be completely under its spell one must be alone with its changing flame. Although I have watched the camp-fire all alone in many scenes,&ndash;in the wilderness, at the shore of the sea, at timber-line, and on the desert in the shadow of the prehistoric cactus,&ndash;nowhere has my imagination been more deeply stirred than it was one night by my camp-fire in a little mountain meadow.
