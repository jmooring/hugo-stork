The site contains 500 articles with an average of 520 words per article.</p><p>One of the configuration options for Stork is <code>save_nearest_html_id</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If <code>true</code>, correlates each word in an HTML document with the nearest ID in the document. The Stork web interface will link directly to that ID, helping your users jump directly to the content they search for.</p></blockquote><p>Test by searching this site for &ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; (case-insensitive). It will bring you to Article 042, targeting the heading nearest to the word.</p><hr><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-199/>Article 199</a></h2>If all this is interpreted to mean that life, that the mind and soul of man, are of material origin, science does not shrink from the inference. Only the inference demands a newer and higher conception of matter&ndash;the conception that Tyndall expressed when he wrote the word with a capital M, and declared that Matter was &ldquo;at bottom essentially mystical and transcendental&rdquo;; that Goethe expressed when he called matter &ldquo;the living garment of God&rdquo;; and that Whitman expressed when he said that the soul and the body were one.

The lake-basin gouged by a glacier goes through many changes before it is covered by a forest and forgotten. No sooner does ice vanish and a glacier lake appear than its filling-in is commenced. Landslips and snow-slides thrust boulders and cliff-fragments into it; running water is constantly depositing sand and sediment upon its bottom. Sedge and moss commence covering its surface as soon as its water becomes shallow.

When it is done with it, it is no longer the obstructive something we know and handle; it is reduced to pure energy&ndash;the line between it and spirit does not exist. We have found that bodies are opaque only to certain rays; the X-ray sees through this too too solid flesh. Bodies are ponderable only to our dull senses; to a finer hand than this the door or the wall might offer no obstruction; a finer eye than this might see the emanations from the living body; a finer ear might hear the clash of electrons in the air.
