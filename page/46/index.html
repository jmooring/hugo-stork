In the heavens one sees power, vastness, sublimity, unspeakable, but one sees only the physical laws working on a grander scale than on the earth. Celestial mechanics do not differ from terrestrial mechanics, however tremendous and imposing the result of their activities. But in the humblest living thing&ndash;in a spear of grass by the roadside, in a gnat, in a flea&ndash;there lurks a greater mystery.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-226/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-227/>Article 227</a></h2>Numerous moraines, terraces, steppes, and moorlands&ndash;the wide sky plains&ndash;have their soil, and this in the warmth of summer generously produces green grass and brilliant flowers. These, together with big game, birds, and circling butterflies, people this zone with life and turn the towering and terraced heights into the rarest of hanging wild gardens. In favored places for a mile or so above timber-line are scattered acres of heathy growths. Stunted by cold, clipped off by the wind, and heavily pressed by the snow, these growths are thickly tangled, bristly, and rarely more than a few inches in height.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-227/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-228/>Article 228</a></h2>Some of the elements seem nearer life than others. Water is near life; heat, light, the colloid state are near life; osmosis, oxidation, chemical reactions are near life; the ashes of inorganic bodies are nearer life than the same minerals in the rocks and soil; but none of these things is life.
The chemical mixture of some of the elements gives us our high explosives&ndash;gunpowder, guncotton, and the like; their organic mixture gives a slower kind of explosive&ndash;bread, meat, milk, fruit, which, when acted upon by the vital forces of the body, yield the force that is the equivalent of the work the body does.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-228/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-229/>Article 229</a></h2>&ldquo;Life is a wave,&rdquo; says Tyndall, but does not one conceive of something, some force or impulse in the wave that is not of the wave? What is it that travels along lifting new water each moment up into waves? It is a physical force communicated usually by the winds. When the wave dies upon the shore, this force is dissipated, not lost, or is turned into heat. Why may we not think of life as a vital force traveling through matter and lifting up into organic life waves in the same way?
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-229/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-230/>Article 230</a></h2>The largest bird resident of the snowy heights is the ptarmigan. Rarely does this bird descend below the timber-line. But a late and prolonged winter storm may drive him and his neighbor the rosy finch a mile or so down the slopes. The first fine day he is back again to the happy heights. The ptarmigan lives in the heathery growths among huge rocky d√©bris. Much of the winter-time he shelters himself in deeply penetrating holes or runs in the compacted snow.
