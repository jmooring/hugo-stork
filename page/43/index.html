The glacial winter has passed away, like the ancient summers and fire periods, though in the chronology of the geologist all these times are recent.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-211/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-212/>Article 212</a></h2>In my youth I once heard the then well-known lecturer Starr King speak on &ldquo;The Law of Disorder.&rdquo; I have no recollection of the main thought of his discourse, but can see that it might have been upon the order and harmony that finally come out of the disharmonies of nature and of man. The whole universe goes blundering on, but surely arrives. Collisions and dispersions in the heavens above, and failure and destruction among living things on the earth below, yet here we all are in a world good to be in!

This force was in the ultimate particles of matter. But when he came to the brain and to consciousness, he said a new product appeared that defies mechanical treatment.
The attempt of the biological science of our time to wipe out all distinctions between the living and the non-living, solely because scientific analysis reveals no difference, is a curious and interesting phenomenon.

All the smaller tributaries whose branches do not reach back to the perennial fountains of the Summit peaks shrink to whispering, tinkling currents.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-214/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-215/>Article 215</a></h2>A limber pine I examined was full of annual rings and experiences. A number of its rings were less than one hundredth of an inch in thickness. At the height of four feet its trunk took on an acute angle and extended nine feet to leeward, then rose vertically for three feet. Its top and limbs merged into a tangled mass about one foot thick, which spread out eight feet horizontally.
