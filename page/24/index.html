All the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-116/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-117/>Article 117</a></h2>Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the adult. Amongst many animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.
Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-117/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-118/>Article 118</a></h2>From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-118/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-119/>Article 119</a></h2>When we speak of the gulf that separates the living from the non-living, are we not thinking of the higher forms of life only? Are we not thinking of the far cry it is from man to inorganic nature? When we get down to the lowest organism, is the gulf so impressive? Under the scrutiny of biologic science the gulf that separates the animal from the vegetable all but vanishes, and the two seem to run together.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-119/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-120/>Article 120</a></h2>The mechanical conception of life repels us because of its association in our minds with the fabrications of our own hands&ndash;the dead metal and wood and the noise and dust of our machine-ridden and machine-produced civilization.
But Nature makes no machines like our own. She uses mechanical principles everywhere, in inert matter and in living bodies, but she does not use them in the bald and literal way we do. We must divest her mechanisms of the rigidity and angularity that pertain to the works of our own hands.
