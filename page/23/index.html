The site contains 500 articles with an average of 520 words per article.</p><p>One of the configuration options for Stork is <code>save_nearest_html_id</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If <code>true</code>, correlates each word in an HTML document with the nearest ID in the document. The Stork web interface will link directly to that ID, helping your users jump directly to the content they search for.</p></blockquote><p>Test by searching this site for &ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; (case-insensitive). It will bring you to Article 042, targeting the heading nearest to the word.</p><hr><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-067/>Article 067</a></h2>The difference between one man and another does not reside in his anatomy or physiology, or in the elements of which the brains and bodies are composed, but in something entirely beyond the reach of experimental science to disclose. The difference is psychological, or, we may say, philosophical, and science is none the wiser for it. The mechanics and the chemistry of a machine are quite sufficient to account for it, plus the man behind it.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-067/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-068/>Article 068</a></h2>Professor Le Dantec says we are mechanisms in the third degree, a mechanism of a mechanism of a mechanism. The body is a mechanism by virtue of its anatomy&ndash;its framework, its levers, its hinges; it is a mechanism by virtue of its chemical activities; and it is a mechanism by virtue of its colloid states&ndash;three kinds of mechanisms in one, and all acting together harmoniously and as a unit&ndash;in other words, a super-mechanical combination of activities.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-068/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-069/>Article 069</a></h2>One other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have been local orconfined to some one spot.
