By the time lodge-poles are sixty years of age their self-thinning has made openings in their crowded ranks. In these openings the shade-enduring seedlings of other species make a start. Years go by, and these seedlings become great trees that overtop the circle of lodge-poles around them.

The view is distasteful to a certain type of mind&ndash;the flexible, imaginative, artistic, and literary type&ndash;the type that loves to see itself reflected in nature or that reads its own thoughts and emotions into nature.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-017/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-018/>Article 018</a></h2>Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other.

He will eat anything that is edible,&ndash;fresh meat or carrion, bark, grass, grasshoppers, ants, fruit, grubs, and leaves. He is fond of honey and with it will consume rotten wood, trash, and bees,&ndash;stings and all. He is a destroyer of many pests that afflict man, and in the realm of economic biology should be rated high for work in this connection. I doubt whether any dozen cats, hawks, or owls annually catch as many mice as he.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-019/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-020/>Article 020</a></h2>Once, while watching a forest fire, I climbed a mountain to a point above the tree-line in order to reach a safe and commanding spot from which to view the flames on a near-by slope. At the summit I came upon a grizzly within a few yards of me. He was squatting on his haunches like a dog, and was intently watching the fire-fount below. A deep roar at one place, high-leaping flames at another, a vast smoke-cloud at another,&ndash;each in turn caught his attention.
