The new leaves and cones are growing fast and make a grand show, seeds are ripening, young birds learning to fly, and with myriads of insects glad as birds keep the air whirling, joy in every wingbeat, their humming and singing blending with the gentle ah-ing of the winds; while at evening every thicket and grove is enchanted by the tranquil chirping of the blessed hylas, the sweetest and most peaceful of sounds, telling the very heart-joy of earth as it rolls through the heavens.

The steam-engine cannot remove its own ash; the &ldquo;living machine&rdquo; can. Much of this ash takes the form of urea, and &ldquo;the seizing upon the urea by the kidney cells is a vital phenomenon.&rdquo; Is not the peristaltic movement of the bowels, by which the solid matter is removed, also a vital phenomenon?
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-092/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-093/>Article 093</a></h2>Biotic energy is peculiar to living bodies, and &ldquo;there are precisely the same criteria for its existence,&rdquo; says Professor Moore, &ldquo;as for the existence of any one of the inorganic energy types, viz., a set of discrete phenomena; and its nature is as mysterious to us as the cause of any one of these inorganic forms about which also we know so little. It is biotic energy which guides the development of the ovum, which regulates the exchanges of the cell, and causes such phenomena as nerve impulse, muscular contraction, and gland secretion, and it is a form of energy which arises in colloidal structures, just as magnetism appears in iron, or radio-activity in uranium or radium, and in its manifestations it undergoes exchanges with other forms of energy, in the same manner as these do among one another.

In this way from any beginning of living material a primitive form of life would spread and would gradually people the globe.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-094/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-095/>Article 095</a></h2>Professor Moore has no sympathy with those narrow mechanistic views that see in the life processes &ldquo;no problems save those of chemistry and physics.&rdquo; &ldquo;Each link in the living chain may be physico-chemical, but the chain as a whole, and its purpose, is something else.&rdquo; He draws an analogy from the production of music in which purely physical factors are concerned; the laws of harmonics account for all; but back of all is something that is not mechanical and chemical&ndash;there is the mind of the composer, and the performers, and the auditors, and something that takes cognizance of the whole effect.
