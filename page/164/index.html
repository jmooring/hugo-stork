Why has it risen? Why did it not keep on the same level, and go through the cycle of change, as the inorganic does, without attaining to higher forms? Because, it may be replied, it was life, and not mere matter and motion&ndash;something that lifts matter and motion to a new plane.
Under the influence of the life impulse, the old routine of matter&ndash;from compound to compound, from solid to fluid, from fluid to gaseous, from rock to soil, the cycle always ending where it began&ndash;is broken into, and cycles of a new order are instituted.

This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered&ndash;a discovery of which the chance is very small.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-491/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-492/>Article 492</a></h2>On my last visit to the region about Kotzebue Sound, near the middle of September, 1881, the weather was so fine and mellow that it suggested the Indian summer of the Eastern States. The winds were hushed, the tundra glowed in creamy golden sunshine, and the colors of the ripe foliage of the heathworts, willows, and birch—red, purple, and yellow, in pure bright tones—were enriched with those of berries which were scattered everywhere, as if they had been showered from the clouds like hail.
