This comparison gives, I think, a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but not of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become associated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states of the body.

Geoffroy St. Hilaire&rsquo;s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception.

Nearly nine tenths of a living body is water; is not this water the same as the water we get at the spring or the brook? is it any more alive?

A man was climbing up. A riderless pony was trotting down. Just as they met, the man made a dash to catch the pony. It swerved and struck with both fore feet. He dodged and made another bold, swift grab for the bridle-rein, but narrowly missed. He staggered, and, before he could recover, the pony wheeled and kicked him headlong.

Why has it risen? Why did it not keep on the same level, and go through the cycle of change, as the inorganic does, without attaining to higher forms? Because, it may be replied, it was life, and not mere matter and motion&ndash;something that lifts matter and motion to a new plane.
Under the influence of the life impulse, the old routine of matter&ndash;from compound to compound, from solid to fluid, from fluid to gaseous, from rock to soil, the cycle always ending where it began&ndash;is broken into, and cycles of a new order are instituted.
