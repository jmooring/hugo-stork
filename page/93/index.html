Vitality is given, and then the vital processes are fitted into mechanical and chemical concepts, or into moulds derived from inert matter&ndash;not a difficult thing to do, but no more an explanation of the mystery of vitality than a painting or a marble bust of Tyndall would be an explanation of that great scientist.

For the most part their food is the larvæ or the eggs that are deposited here and there in the tree by hundreds of kinds of insects and parasites which afflict trees. Nothing except a heavy sleet appears to make these food-deposits inaccessible.
Most birds spend the winter months in the South. But bad conditions may cause resident birds and animals to migrate, even in midwinter.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-462/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-463/>Article 463</a></h2>Tyndall has said that a few days of mountain-climbing will burn all the effete matter out of the system. In climbing, the stagnant blood is circulated and refined, the lungs are exercised, every cell is cleansed, and all parts are disinfected by the pure air. Climbing a high peak occasionally will not only postpone death but will give continuous intensity to the joy of living. Every one might well climb at least one high peak, and for those leaving high school or college, the post-graduate work of climbing a rugged peak might be a more informative experience or a more helpful test for living than any examination or the writing of a thesis.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-463/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-464/>Article 464</a></h2>The mountain mass which culminates in Pike&rsquo;s Peak probably originated as a vast uplift. Internal forces appear to have severed this mass from its surroundings and slowly upraised it seven thousand or more feet. The slow uprising probably ended thousands of years ago. Since that time, disintegration, frost, air, and stream erosion have combined to sculpture this great peak. Pike&rsquo;s Peak might well be made a National Park.
The comparative merits of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains for recreation purposes are frequently discussed.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-464/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-465/>Article 465</a></h2>Associated with this grand tree in the making of the Flathead forests is the large and beautiful mountain pine, or Western white pine (Pinus monticola), the invincible contorta or lodge-pole pine, and spruce and cedar. The forest floor is covered with the richest beds of Linnæa borealis I ever saw, thick fragrant carpets, enriched with shining mosses here and there, and with Clintonia, pyrola, moneses, and vaccinium, weaving hundred-mile beds of bloom that would have made blessed old Linnæus weep for joy.
