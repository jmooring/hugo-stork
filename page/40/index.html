Living matter is actuated by intelligence. Its activities are spontaneous and self-directing. The rock, and the tree that grows beside it, and the insects and rodents that burrow under it, may all be made of one stuff, but their difference to the beholder is fundamental; there is an intelligent activity in the one that is not in the other.

In climbing, the stagnant blood is circulated and refined, the lungs are exercised, every cell is cleansed, and all parts are disinfected by the pure air. Climbing a high peak occasionally will not only postpone death but will give continuous intensity to the joy of living. Every one might well climb at least one high peak, and for those leaving high school or college, the post-graduate work of climbing a rugged peak might be a more informative experience or a more helpful test for living than any examination or the writing of a thesis.

For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms&ndash;the old and the new&ndash;would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors.

Only the inference demands a newer and higher conception of matter&ndash;the conception that Tyndall expressed when he wrote the word with a capital M, and declared that Matter was &ldquo;at bottom essentially mystical and transcendental&rdquo;; that Goethe expressed when he called matter &ldquo;the living garment of God&rdquo;; and that Whitman expressed when he said that the soul and the body were one.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-199/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-200/>Article 200</a></h2>Glacier meadows may be seen in all stages of evolution. The lake-basin gouged by a glacier goes through many changes before it is covered by a forest and forgotten. No sooner does ice vanish and a glacier lake appear than its filling-in is commenced. Landslips and snow-slides thrust boulders and cliff-fragments into it; running water is constantly depositing sand and sediment upon its bottom. Sedge and moss commence covering its surface as soon as its water becomes shallow.
