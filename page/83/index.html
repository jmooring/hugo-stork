If the evolutionary impulse fails on one line, it picks itself up and tries on another, it experiments endlessly like an inventor, but always improves on its last attempts. Chance would have kept things at a standstill; the principle of chance, give it time enough, must end where it began.

The organic compounds are vastly more sensitive to light and heat and air than are the same elements in the inorganic world.

The following afternoon, while waiting for sunset over Trout Lake, I lay down for a sleep on the grass in a sun-filled opening surrounded by clumps of tall spruces. Trusting Cricket to stay near, I threw her bridle-rein over her head to the ground and thus set her free. In the sunny, dry air I quickly fell asleep. An hour later, a snorting explosion on the top of my head awakened me.
<a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-414/>More...</a><h2><a href=/hugo-stork/articles/article-415/>Article 415</a></h2>Another Harvard voice is less pronounced in favor of the mechanistic conception of life. Professor Rand thinks that in a mechanically determined universe, &ldquo;our conscious life becomes a meaningless replica of an inexorable physical concatenation&rdquo;&ndash;the soul the result of a fortuitous concourse of atoms. Hence all the science and art and literature and religion of the world are merely the result of a molecular accident.
Dr. Rand himself, in wrestling with the problem of organization in a late number of &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; seems to hesitate whether or not to regard man as a molecular accident, an appearance presented to us by the results of the curious accidents of molecules&ndash;which is essentially Professor Loeb&rsquo;s view; or whether to look upon the living body as the result of a &ldquo;specific something&rdquo; that organizes, that is, of &ldquo;dominating organic agencies,&rdquo; be they psychic or super-mundane, which dominate and determine the organization of the different parts of the body into a whole.
